      Poczta Polska free shipping Bagslife

      We provide FREE SHIPPING to the whole world without any hidden costs on our side.

      We send goods from Poland via Poczta Polska.
      Estimated delivery times (in accordance with the Poczta Polska specification):

      North America: 2-3 weeks
      Europe: 3-10 business days
      Australia, New Zealand and Oceania: 2-4 weeks
      Asia Pacific: 2-3 weeks
      Latin America and the Caribbean: 2-3 weeks
      North Africa and the Middle East: 2-3 weeks
      Sub-Saharan Africa: 2-3 weeks
      We’ll do our best to meet these shipping estimates, but cannot guarantee them.

      Important note:
      Poczta Polska guarantees delivery of the parcel to the country of destination within 4 days (Europe) or 6 days (all other areas). And Poczta Polska really (!) does it. Then the parcel is taken over by customs offices and other carriers. This is the reason why the global delivery time may differ from the expected one.

      You can opt out of free shipping via Poczta Polska. If you decide to use another carrier’s services, then we have to set individual shipping costs for each order.

      Customs and import taxes
      Our price does not include any customs rates applicable in your country. Buyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. (Note: if the shipping address is outside of Europe – check if customs tariffs apply to your order).

      We are not responsible for delays due to customs.
